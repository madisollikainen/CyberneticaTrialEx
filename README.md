# CyberneticaTrialEx
This is a repository holding my solution to the trial excercise I got from the Sharemind team in Cybernetica AS.

## Overview

Sharemind is a secure multi-party computation based database/application server, which allows processing of encrypted data without the need for decryption. Applications on the Sharemind server are written in the SecreC programming language, which separates private and public data on a type system level. The Sharemind SDK provides the SecreC language and compilers as well as a Sharemind server emulator for testing. For my trial exercise I had to familiarise myself with Sharemind SDK and solve a few tasks related to implementing/analysing selection algorithms.
